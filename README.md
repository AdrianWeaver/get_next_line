# Project Get Next Line (GNL)

## Overview
The Get Next Line (GNL) project at School 42 aks us to create a function that reads a line from a file descriptor, effectively enabling sequential reading of a file line by line. This project focuses on file manipulation, memory allocation, and the intricacies of handling file descriptors in C.

## Importance of Authentic Learning
📚 **Authentic Learning:** 📚
At its core, School 42 encourages a culture of authentic learning. The emphasis lies not only in flawless execution but in understanding concepts, problem-solving, and honing coding skills. Copying or cheating dilutes the essence of this learning experience, hindering personal growth and skill development. **For 42 students who might read this, I strongly advocate for discussing concepts with peers instead of directly referring to this code.** If you came here for advices, my advice would be: learn to test your code, go read about test driven development.

## Coding Foundations: The GNL wall
🧠 **What future-me thinks he learned coding GNL:** 🧠
Starting GNL felt like hitting a wall several times in a row and enjoying it. Understanding and using static variables was a challenge back then that now seems trivial. I also had a lot to learn about files in UNIX systems, and file descriptors which proved tricky when trying to test my own code. 
This project helped me learn a lot about memory allocation, what a program leaking means when using dynamically allocated memory. How to make your choose between stack and heap usage. It also helped me get more confident when coding, mostly because I had to re-write everything from scratch several times to fix my errors.  Following coding norms also became a habit through this experience.
